# Project 2: Boosted Trees - Statistical/Machine Learning Presentation

## Project Overview
This project provides an educational presentation on **Boosted Trees** as part of a Statistical/Machine Learning course. Boosted Trees are a powerful ensemble learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. This presentation is designed to introduce the theory, motivation, and practical implementation of boosted trees to classmates, with a focus on explaining key concepts, demonstrating the method on example datasets, and discussing real-world applications.

## Presentation Goals
- **Explain Boosted Trees**: Provide a clear, concise introduction to boosted trees, focusing on its algorithm, motivation, and practical uses.
- **Illustrate Key Concepts**: Cover essential terms and ideas, including weak learners, gradient boosting, boosting rounds, and parameters like learning rate and tree depth.
- **Demonstrate Using Examples**: Showcase the method using a small "baby" dataset (e.g., `iris` or `mtcars`) and a larger, self-collected dataset from a relevant research area.
- **Guide Through Practical Implementation**: Walk through the process of building, tuning, and evaluating a boosted tree model using R, with code snippets, visualizations, and interpretations.
- **Highlight Limitations and Applications**: Address the strengths, limitations, and real-world applications of boosted trees in various fields.

## File Structure
- `Project_2_Boosted_Trees_Presentation.Rmd`: The main R Markdown file for the presentation, designed to be compiled as an HTML or PDF slide deck using `xaringan`.
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used in the project, including both the "baby" dataset and the larger self-collected dataset hosted as a `.csv` file.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project, its goals, structure, and usage.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need:
- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- R packages: `xaringan`, `tidyverse`, `xaringanthemer`, `ggplot2`, `knitr`, and any additional dependencies listed in `Project_2_Boosted_Trees_Presentation.Rmd`.

## How to Run
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-2-boosted-trees
